# CMS Native PHP

- Content management system build with php native. 
- It's a blog with 2 types of roles [Admin - User].
- It come with some validation with input and some permission.

What you can do as [Admin]:
<br>
  <li>Add    (category - post - user)</li>
  <li>Delete (category - post - user)</li>
  <li>Update (category - post - user)</li>
  <li>Approve / draft commet</li>
  <li>Publish / draft commet</li>
  <br>
What you can do as [User]: 
<br>
  <li>See posts</li>
  <li>Like / dislike posts</li>
  <li>Add comment</li>
  <br>
Lastly, I try to do some validation to prevent security vulnerability like (xss, sql,idor)
