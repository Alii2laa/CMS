# CMS Native PHP

- Content management system build with php native. 
- It's a blog with 2 types of roles [Admin - User].
- It come with some validation with input and some permission.

What you can do as [Admin]:
<br>
 - Add    (category - post - user)
 - Delete (category - post - user)
 - Update (category - post - user)
 - Approve / draft commet
 - Publish / draft commet
  <br>
What you can do as [User]: 
<br>
 - See posts
 - Like / dislike posts
 - Add comment
  <br>
Lastly, I try to do some validation to prevent security vulnerability like (xss, sql,idor)
